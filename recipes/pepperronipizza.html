                <ul>
                    <li>3 1/4 cups all purpose flour or more as needed</li>
                    <li>2 (0.25 ounce) envelopes Fleischmann's Pizza Crust Yeast or Rapid Rise Yeast</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                    <li>1 1/3 cups very warm water (120-130 Fahrenheit)</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup oil</li>
                </ul>
            <h6>Toppings</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 (6 ounce) package Hormel Pepperoni</li>
                    <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
                </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a 
                        medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. 
                        Freeze remaining paste .</li>
                    <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar 
                        and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended 
                        (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, 
                        until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
                    <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is 
                        smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRiseÂ® 
                        Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
                    <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 
                        12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
                    <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, 
                        pepperoni and cheese.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is 
                        bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom 
                        oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
                </ol>
